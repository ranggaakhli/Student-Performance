# Student-Performance

Student exam performance may differ based on factors such as gender, parental education, test preparation, or lunch programs. This study applies statistical tests to explore whether these factors are associated with differences in math, reading, and writing exam scores. The goal is to identify statistical relationships rather than determine causal effects.
To do so, we first test for normality to determine the appropriate statistical approach. Depending on the distribution, we apply either parametric or non-parametric tests, using one-tailed or two-tailed analyses based on the research questions. When significant differences are found, post-hoc tests will be provided to gain further insights
